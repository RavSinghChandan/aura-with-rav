# 360° Growth Framework (6 Dimensions)

Every day must touch these 6 areas:

1. Technical Growth
2. Physical Health
3. Mental Clarity
4. Spiritual Grounding
5. Brand Building
6. Financial Awareness

If one dimension is ignored repeatedly → imbalance begins.

# 1️⃣ Technical Growth (Career Thriving)

Minimum Daily Standard:

* 60–90 minutes focused learning or building
* DSA / System Design / Backend depth

* Architecture thinking

Rule:

Don’t just code.
Think like architect.

Ask daily:

* How can this system scale?
* How does memory behave?
* Where does latency hide?

Become rare, not replaceable.

# 2️⃣ Physical Health (Energy Foundation)

Without energy, nothing grows.

Daily Non-Negotiables:

That is strength.

# 4️⃣ Spiritual Grounding

You are not building superstition.
You are building awareness.

Daily:

* Mantra / chanting with focus (not escape)

Do not imagine yourself as extraordinary.

Do not collapse.

Stability is power.
