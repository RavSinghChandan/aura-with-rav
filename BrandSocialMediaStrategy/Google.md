# Aura with Rav – Google Presence Strategy (Authority & Trust Engine)

## Vision (Lifetime Perspective)

Google is not for content.
Google is for credibility.

Aura with Rav on Google exists to:

* Establish trust
* Capture high-intent clients
* Build premium positioning
* Convert searches into consultations

Google = Trust Engine
Instagram = Attraction
YouTube = Depth

---

# Core Objective

When someone searches:

* “Best astrologer in Pune”
* “Palm reader near me”
* “Vastu consultant Pune”
* “Numerology expert India”

Aura with Rav must appear as:

Professional
Calm
Authentic
Premium
Structured

Not mystical. Not dramatic. Not exaggerated.

---

# Positioning Statement

Aura with Rav is:

A modern spiritual consulting brand blending
ancient Indian wisdom with analytical clarity.

Position as:

“Engineer turned Consciousness Consultant”

This differentiates you from:

* Local pandits
* Fear-based astrologers
* Generic tarot readers

---

# Google Business Profile Optimization

## 1. Category Strategy

Primary Category:
Astrologer

Secondary Categories:

* Vastu Consultant
* Numerologist
* Tarot Card Reader
* Spiritual Counselor

---

## 2. Description Structure

Always include:

* Who you are
* What makes you different
* Services offered
* Location (Pune)
* Online consultation availability
* Clear positioning statement

Tone:
Professional. Calm. Structured.

---

## 3. Photos Strategy

Upload:

* Professional seated photo (calm background)
* Workspace setup
* Consultation environment
* Books / discipline setup
* Minimal spiritual aesthetic

Avoid:

* Overly dramatic religious images
* Flashy astrology charts
* Loud graphics

Your profile should look like:

Spiritual Consultant, not street astrologer.

---

# Review Strategy (Very Important)

Google reviews = Reputation currency.

After every consultation:

Politely request review with this structure:

Ask client to mention:

* What problem they had
* What clarity they received
* How the session felt
* Why they recommend you

Target:
100+ genuine reviews in 2 years.

Never:

* Buy reviews
* Fake testimonials

Authenticity builds long-term authority.

---

# SEO Keyword Philosophy

Naturally include:

* Astrologer in Pune
* Vastu expert Pune
* Numerology consultation India
* Online tarot reading
* Palm reading expert

But never stuff keywords unnaturally.

Clarity > Keyword stuffing.

---

# 2-Year Growth Plan

## Phase 1 (0–6 Months) – Foundation

* Optimize profile completely
* Upload 10–15 quality photos
* Collect 20 genuine reviews
* Post weekly Google updates

Expected:
Better local ranking visibility.

---

## Phase 2 (6–12 Months) – Authority

* Publish weekly Google posts
* Share blog-style mini insights
* Increase review count to 50+
* Improve response time to inquiries

Expected:
Top 3 local listing potential (if consistent).

---

## Phase 3 (Year 2) – Premium Perception

* 100+ reviews
* Strong 4.8+ rating
* Recognizable brand presence
* Direct client referrals from Google

Goal:
Google becomes primary consultation funnel.

---

# Google Posts Strategy (Weekly)

Every week post:

1. Spiritual insight
2. Client testimonial highlight
3. Service explanation
4. Short educational content

Keep tone educational, not promotional.

---

# Inquiry Handling Rule

When someone messages:

Reply within 1–3 hours.

Structure:

1. Greet calmly.
2. Ask their concern briefly.
3. Offer structured session.
4. Mention consultation format.
5. Keep tone professional.

Never negotiate emotionally.

---

# Pricing Philosophy

Do not position as cheap.

Premium attracts serious clients.

If pricing is low:
Increase gradually every 6 months.

Authority must grow with pricing.

---

# What I Want From Google

Not traffic.
Not random inquiries.

I want:

* High-quality clients
* Premium perception
* Trust authority
* Long-term credibility

---

# 5 Authority Parameters (Before Updating Profile)

1. Does this increase professionalism?
2. Does this reflect discipline?
3. Is this fear-free messaging?
4. Is this structured and clear?
5. Does this align with premium positioning?

If 3 fail → Do not publish.

---

# Long-Term Identity

Within 2 years, when someone searches:

“Astrologer Pune”

They should feel:

“This is not a typical astrologer.
This feels intellectual and grounded.”

That is the goal.
