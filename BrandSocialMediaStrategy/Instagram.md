Instagram is not for attention.
It is for positioning.

Aura with Rav on Instagram exists to:

* Build intellectual spiritual authority
* Attract conscious individuals
* Convert audience into community
* Establish Rav as a premium personal brand

Instagram = Attraction Engine
YouTube = Depth Engine

# Core Identity

I am not an “Instagram astrologer.”
I am:

* A Consciousness Analyst
* A Logical Spiritualist
* An Engineer Decoding Energy

My page must feel:

Calm
Premium
Grounded
Intelligent
Minimal

Never loud. Never desperate. Never trend-chasing.

# Instagram Content Pillars

All content must fall under one of these 4 pillars:

## 1. Consciousness & Thought Leadership

Short philosophical insights in Hindi.

Examples:

* “धर्म अलग हैं, चेतना अलग नहीं”
* “आपकी समस्या भाग्य नहीं, निर्णय है”

Goal:
Position Rav as thinker, not predictor.

---

## 2. Applied Spiritual Science

Short value-based content:

People trust who you ARE, not what you SAY.

Real-world application.

---

# Personal Discipline Rule

Before posting:

Ask:

Is this ego content or awareness content?

If ego → Don’t post.
If awareness → Post confidently.

---

# What I Want From Instagram

Not validation.
Not random fame.

I want:

* Respect
* Authority
* Intelligent audience
* Strong brand recall

---

# 5 Brand Parameters (Check Before Posting)

1. Does this increase authority?
2. Does this reflect discipline?
3. Is this intellectually clean?
4. Is this spiritually grounded?
5. Is this aligned with long-term vision?

If 3 fail → Don’t post.

---

# Long-Term Identity

Within 2 years, people should say:

“He is not just an astrologer.
He makes you think.”

That is the brand.

---

# Final Commitment

I will not chase trends.
I will build positioning.
I will not shout for attention.
I will speak with depth.

Aura with Rav is not content creation.
It is perception engineering.
