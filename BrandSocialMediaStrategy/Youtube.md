# Brand Positioning Parameters

Always check content against these 5 parameters:

## 1. Clarity

Is this understandable to a 16-year-old?

## 2. Depth

Does this add real insight?

Am I speaking neutrally about religion?

## 4. Authority

Do I sound stable and grounded?

## 5. Authenticity

Does this feel like me?

If 3/5 fail → Do not upload.

# Thumbnail & Title Philosophy

Thumbnails:

* Minimal text
* Strong emotion
* Direct eye contact
* Dark + golden tone (spiritual aesthetic)

Titles:

* Question-based
* Slightly controversial
* Clear benefit

Example:
“धर्म क्यों लड़ते हैं? सच जो आपको नहीं बताया गया”

---

# Personal Discipline Rule

Before recording:

* 10 minutes silence
* Calm breathing
* No ego state
* Speak from awareness, not excitement

Never record when:

* Emotionally unstable
* Ego high
* Angry
* Seeking validation

---

# Monetization Strategy (After 10K)

Income Sources:

* 1:1 Consultations
* Paid workshops
* Online course
* Spiritual community membership
* Digital remedies guide

Never:

* Sell fear.
* Manipulate belief.

---

# Content Evolution Rule

Every 6 months ask:

* Am I repeating myself?
* Am I growing intellectually?
* Is my audience growing in awareness?
* Am I becoming deeper or louder?

If louder → Reset.

---

# What I Want From YouTube

Not fame.
Not validation.
Not ego boost.

I want:

* Influence
* Respect
* Authority
* Financial independence through wisdom
* A legacy brand

---

# Golden Rule

Do not chase virality.
Chase depth.

Virality is temporary.
Depth builds legacy.

---

# Final Commitment Statement

I commit to:

Consistency over mood.
Discipline over excitement.
Clarity over controversy.
Wisdom over popularity.

Aura with Rav is not content creation.
It is consciousness engineering.
